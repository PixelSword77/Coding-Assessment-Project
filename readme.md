# Coding Assessment
A coding assessment project simulating a proof of concept for a shopping experience, featuring a list of products with individual codes and prices, and discounts for certain product combinations and delivery fee discounts based on cart total.

## Background
While I have never used PHP before, I decided to take the challenge and learn it from the ground up for this project. I'm utilizing a Windows 11 VM on my Linux machine as my working environment, and Apache as a local server host to run and test the program. I will also be using MySQL and databases to store the product information as a challenge and learning experience for myself.

## Questions and Edge Cases

### When calculating delivery costs, do we calculate all prior special offers first?
I would say in this instance, yes, calculate the total cart cost, including special discounts such as the "buy one red flower, get second half price", before shipping, as this is how most companies in my experience handle it.
